### Pie charts that shows the relationship between the following variables
* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type


### Analysis Symmary

* Roughly 70% of all rides and 63% total fares come from Urban riders.
* Over 80% drivers come from Urban.
* Average fare is lower in urban areas in general.
* Over 35% fares come from Rural and Suburban areas, there are less than 20% drivers in Rural and Suburban areas. That maybe the reason that the fares are higher in these areas.

The analysis shows that there may be a strategic opportunity to boost driver counts in the Suburban and Rural cities to enhance market share.
