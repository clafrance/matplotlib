### Analysis Symmary

* Roughly 70% of rides and 63% of fares come from urban riders.
* Over 80% of drivers come from urban areas.
* Average fare is generally lower in urban areas than outside of them.
* About 37% of fares come from rural and suburban areas, yet less than 20% drivers are from these areas, potentially causing the higher fares in these areas.

The analysis shows that there may be an opportunity to enhance market share by boosting driver counts in suburban and rural areas.
